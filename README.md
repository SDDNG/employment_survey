# Employment (IT Sector Salary) Survey
This application allows a user to enter respondents' details into an IT salary survey and then to compare a respondent's salary to the salary of either, other respondents, or, to salaries nationally based on data held on the IT sector.  

Comparisons can be in terms of either role, experience or simply all to other employees. At least one respondent's details must be entered in a session before any comparison reports can be run and during any session, a user can enter as many respondents' details as they wish. If the user has entered only one respondent and then chooses to run a report, the application automatically selects that one respondent, if however, they have entered more than one respondent, they are prompted to select the respondent they wish to run comparisons against.
